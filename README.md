# DesignPatterns

1) How is decorator different from chain of responsibility pattern ?

Chain of Responsibility pattern comes under behavioural patttern. It creates a chain of receiver 
objects for a request. If one object cannot handle the request, then the request is passed to
the next object.

Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering 
its structure. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts 
as a wrapper to existing class.
